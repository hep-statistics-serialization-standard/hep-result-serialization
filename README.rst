HEP result serialization
*********************

Goal
====
HEP-result-serialization standardizes the machine- and human-readable serialization of
statistics result in High Energy Physics. The aim is to provide on one hand a language and
framework agnostic, machine-reabable and on the other hand a
human-readable, publishable and preservable representation.
